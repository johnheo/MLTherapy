LCD is connected to the I2C 2 port on the grovepi shield, while the speaker needs to be manually connected and set as default output.  
Both files inside "rpi" folder are supposed to run on a raspberrypi.
File "index.html" inside "jsfolder" folder is suppose to run on one's browser on a laptop with webcam. 

"playmusic.py" and "subscriber.py" will only start working once the user confirmed the emotion predicted from "index.html".
